# Names

Names are what we call ourselves and what others call us. They are a special kind of identifier because they are the link between us and the social world around us. We present ourselves using names so people know how to refer to us when talking to others or call us when they are talking to us. They convey meaning and have power.

Digital devices can also have names are defined by the administrators of these devices. Places have names given to them by people in a given context these help us refer to a geographic location. It should be noted that the names First Nations (Native American Indian) people had for places are different then the ones that the Canadian's and American’s colonized their land used.

## Given Names
These are the names our parents give us when we are born. In America we have a naming convention of a first name and last name. This convention originates from western when states were seeking to impose control. (Seeing like a state)

## Name structure in various cultures
Different cultures have very different naming conventions.

I share these to help those of you reading from a western context to break out of the "Universalism" of our way of doing things. Many of the things we think of as universal around naming and identity are very recent and arise from western European states need to document their citizens this is how we got surnames. 

In Hong Kong there is a convention of an english first name written in English and a Chinese character written last name. In Mayanmar everyone has a first name. In mainland China the family name is first then the given name. 




## Meaning in Wisdom Traditions
Different wisdom traditions ascribe different ways to interpret and ascribe meaning in names.

## NickName
These arise when people start to refer to us by a different name then the name we might give ourselves. We can take these on and they can become our name. They might arise from our families, from school, from sports teams, social clubs, work places. In these different contexts, the name that we are referred to may have nothing to do with the name our our birth certificate and the people using the name to refer to us.

## Name on Government Issued Paperwork
We have a convention in the liberal west of registering names with the state. This originated out of several practices in the last several hundred years. One key aspect of this is to both provide services to citizens but also to control citizens.

## Pen Name / Stage Name
A name used by artists for their artistic expression and authorship. It does not match the name on government issued paperwork and is often used to obscure the link between such authorship and government paperwork names so that they are free to express themselves artistically.

## Autonym
A name that one uses to refer to themselves. An example is that when Jorge Mario Bergoglio became pope he chose to become Pope Francis.


## Pseudonym
A name that one uses to interact in various contexts that may be linked one’s name on one’s government issued paperwork. Bob is clearly linked to the name Robert or Barb to Barbara or Liz to Elizabeth on government issued paperwork. It is important to note that many Non-European languages also have examples of these common customs of name shortening.


## Mononym
This is name consisting of a single word. Examples include Stilgarian and Sai. Madonna or Cher are examples of Pseudonymous, Mononym, Stage Names

## Handle
A name that one uses to represent ones digital identity in online contexts. It arose in computer culture when people needed to have a user name within a computer system. This is closely related to Screen names.

## Screen Name
The name that one chooses to have displayed on screen. In a system like World of Warcraft the service knows identity information of their clients who pay monthly to access their service. They choose to support those player presenting to the other players on the system and forums a “screen name” that reflects their gaming persona or character name.

## Name Haystack
Different Names have different qualities of hiding in the haystack of the similar or the same names. Some people have huge name – haystacks where tens of thousands people have the same name – Mike Smith, Joe Johnston, Mohamed Husain, Avi Blum, Katherine Jones. Mike Garcia who worked for NIST said that there were 17 different Mike or Michael Garcia’s (working for the federal government). People use pseudonyms to help manage the fact that name-haystacks exist making them more or less identifiable depending on the size of theirs.



# Roles
RBAC – Roll Based Access Control is based on managing the rights and privileges for digital systems based on roles. When a person gets a role assigned to them the inherit the privileges.

Community groups also have different roles that might have . Earn role from getting a degree.

Titles, Given and Created
There is a history of titles being pasted down.

Eastern Wisdom Traditions pass them down from guru to student creating lineage’s.

I have had conversations with friends about who the next “Identity Woman” might be. This identity that I have constructed to hold an aspect of my self – work focused on people’s rights around their digital selves. I could see at some point handing this identity over to someone else who wants to continue the torch over.

Collective Single Identity
Theses identities are co-created by two or more people. They are managed and maintained and people jointly act together to create a persona.
