# Preface  {-}

This is a work-in-progress. 

"The Field Guide to Identity: Identifiers, Attributes, Names and More" was originally submitted to the 2014 ID360 Conference hosted by the Center for Identity at the University of Texas at Austin, yet illness delayed the presentation. 

The draft paper was published in 2014 on [identitywoman.net](https://identitywoman.net) as four part series:

* Part 1: [Intro + what is Identity?](https://identitywoman.net/the-field-guide-to-identity-identifiers-attributes-names-and-more)
* Part 2: [Names](https://identitywoman.net/the-field-guide-to-identity-identifiers-attributes-names-and-more-part-2-names)
* Part 3: [Identifiers](https://identitywoman.net/the-field-guide-to-identity-identifiers-attributes-names-and-more-part-3-identifiers/)
* Part 4: [Name Space, Attributes and Conclusion](https://identitywoman.net/the-field-guide-to-identity-identifiers-attributes-names-and-more-part-4-name-spaces-attributes-conclusion)
